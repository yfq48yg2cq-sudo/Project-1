      An acheivement for me was the pursuit of education in my 50's.  While sitting in class with people almost a 1/3 my age can be intimidating, i enjoy the learning.
      A great asset to my education is Hercules! He helps me focus and study (not really).  He's a great boy with a fun personality, he loves hugs and expensive steak.  
      Considering its his first time in school he's doing great at Illinois Tech!  Most of the development is actually done with him.  When i get something right, he chases his tail.
      When i need help, he jumps on me (he still thinks he's a puppy).
